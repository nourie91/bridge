# Changelog

All notable changes to Bridge DS are documented here.

## [3.2.2] — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Plugin manifest versions aligned at `3.2.2` across `package.json`,
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and
  `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (resolves prior version drift).
- `skills/design-workflow/SKILL.md` frontmatter updated to
  `name: design-workflow` / `version: 3.2.2`.

### Fixed
- README: corrected Figma Desktop plugin import instructions (point to
  the `figma-console-mcp` manifest rather than a non-existent file).
- README: documented the `specs/backlog/` directory created by
  `bridge-ds init`.

## [3.2.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- **`skills/using-bridge/`** — Force-loaded process-layer skill (~400 tokens) owning Bridge's discipline, command map, non-negotiable hard rules, and Red Flags rationalization catalog. Injected at every Claude Code session via the SessionStart hook.
- **`hooks/session-start`** — POSIX shell script that strips YAML frontmatter from `skills/using-bridge/SKILL.md` and emits the Claude Code SessionStart JSON payload.
- **`hooks/hooks.json`** — Claude Code hook registration; binds `session-start` to the SessionStart event so `using-bridge` is injected automatically.
- **`<HARD-GATE>` block** in `skills/design-workflow/SKILL.md` — Five non-negotiable rules enforced prompt-side: no raw Plugin API code, no hardcoded primitives, no ship without compiler+screenshot+user-confirmation, never read `figma-api-rules.md`, never reuse nodeIds across sessions.
- **Red Flags rationalization table** in `skills/design-workflow/SKILL.md` — Eight common rationalizations with reality counters (hardcode shortcuts, compiler skepticism, screenshot skipping, stale nodeId memory, forbidden API reads, user-approval workarounds, raw Plugin API reuse, inline scripting).

### Changed
- **`skills/design-workflow/SKILL.md` description** rewritten as triggers-only (per `obra/superpowers` research — workflow-summary descriptions cause LLM shortcutting).
- **Action Router slimmed** in `skills/design-workflow/SKILL.md` — keyword→action routing delegated to `skills/using-bridge/SKILL.md`; design-workflow retains the minimal action→file map for self-sufficiency when invoked directly (~40 lines saved).
- **`package.json` + `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** version aligned at `3.2.0` (fixes pre-existing drift from `3.1.0` / `3.0.1`).
- **`package.json` `files` array** now includes `hooks/` for npm distribution.

### Notes

No breaking changes.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Declarative setup steps** — SKILL.md now includes `setup:` array with typed steps for bridge-app's Setup Engine
- **Manifest extensions** — `requires`, `priority_references`, `generation_phases`, `readiness` in SKILL.md frontmatter
- **Readiness checks** — `figma-connected` (mcp_tool) and `knowledge-base` (kb_populated)

## [3.0.1] — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Compiler: `CompilerError` now extends `Error` for proper catch/stack traces
- Compiler: fixed ~28 broken constructor calls in schema validation
- Compiler: aligned validation severity with push destinations (errors vs warnings)
- Compiler: added try/catch around wrap stage to prevent uncaught throws
- Compiler: removed dead code (unused import, no-op function, dead concat)
- Docs: replaced all stale v2 terminology (`learn`→`fix`, `spec`→`make`, `PASS review`→`<= 2 corrections`)
- CLI: removed obsolete `learn` command from help text

## [3.0.0] — 2026-03-28

### Breaking
- Complete architecture rewrite: compiler-driven generation replaces manual Plugin API scripting
- Command restructure: `make`/`fix`/`done` replace `spec`/`design`/`review`/`quick`/`sync`/`learn`
- Spec format: CSpec YAML replaces markdown templates
- Removed: `figma-api-rules.md` (rules now enforced by compiler), `bundle.js`, old action files

### Added
- **Scene Graph Compiler** (`lib/compiler/`): declarative JSON to correct Figma Plugin API scripts
  - 26 Figma API rules enforced automatically by code generation
  - Token/component resolution with fuzzy error suggestions
  - Multi-chunk support with globalThis bridging
  - Transport-aware output (console IIFE vs official top-level await)
  - Compile-time validation (catches errors before Figma execution)
- **CSpec format**: YAML-based compilable specifications (human-readable + machine-parseable)
- **Recipe system**: pre-built scene graph templates that evolve with user corrections
- **Unified `make` command**: spec + design + review in one continuous flow
- **`fix` command**: snapshot diff, learning extraction, recipe auto-patching
- **Compiler reference**: concise 2.5K-token reference replaces 13K-token rules document

### Removed
- `figma-api-rules.md` — rules moved into compiler internals
- `bundle.js` — replaced by compiler
- `spec.md`, `design.md`, `review.md`, `quick.md`, `sync.md` — replaced by `make.md`
- `spec-template.md`, `screen-template.md` — replaced by CSpec YAML templates
- `onboarding.md` — replaced by `setup.md`

## [2.5.1] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Rule 24**: Never screenshot a page or empty node — create a frame first
- **Rule 25**: Input/Select components — swap to `state=filled` for real values
- **Rule 26**: Validate registry keys before writing scripts — copy-paste from registries, never type manually
- `quick.md`: References Rules 24-26 in generation steps

## [2.5.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Dual MCP transport**: Support for both figma-console-mcp (preferred) and official Figma MCP server (fallback). Auto-detection picks the best available transport.
- **Express mode**: `/design-workflow quick` skips formal spec, generates from brief description with 2 questions max. Same DS quality guarantees.
- **Plugin packaging**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` for marketplace distribution.
- **Transport adapter**: `transport-adapter.md` — central reference for tool mapping, script adaptation, and composite DS extraction.
- **Rule 23**: Transport-aware scripting in `figma-api-rules.md` (IIFE vs top-level await, official transport constraints).
- **KB path resolution**: `./bridge-ds/` (plugin mode) or `.claude/skills/` (npm scaffold mode).
- **`.mcp.json`**: MCP server dependency declaration for plugin installs.

### Changed
- `mcp-setup.js`: Returns `{ console, official }` instead of boolean.
- `cli.js`: Reports both transports during init, offers dual setup instructions.
- `onboarding.md`: Dual transport detection + composite DS extraction for official transport.
- `quality-gates.md`: Quick mode section with relaxed gates (pattern matching best-effort, no formal spec/review).
- 6 schema files updated with transport notes.
- `package.json`: Bumped to v2.5.0, added plugin manifests to `files`.

## [2.4.1] — 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **review.md**: Sections F (Component API Quality) and G (Learning Opportunity) were in wrong order
- **CLI help**: Added missing `drop`, `learn`, `sync`, `status` slash commands
- **README.md**: Added missing `learn` and `sync` commands to table; updated workflow diagram with learning loop
- **design.md**: Fixed incorrect absolute path to knowledge base (now relative `references/knowledge-base/`)
- **done.md**: Added `Learnings: {n} persisted` to output template
- **scaffold.js**: Added `learnings.json` to `.gitignore` entries; `update()` now preserves `learnings.json`

### Added
- **Templates**: "Known Preferences" section in both `screen-template.md` and `spec-template.md`
- **CHANGELOG.md**: This file

## [2.4.0] — 2026-03-19

### Added
- Learning loop: `learn` action diffs Figma corrections against generation snapshot, extracts reusable preferences
- Incremental DS sync: `sync` action updates registries without full re-setup
- `status` action shows current workflow state and suggests next step
- `drop` action abandons work with preserved learnings
- Snapshot capture after design generation for learn diffing
